You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a 4-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both 2-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.
